# AI-Driven Trade Risk Assessment and Stress Testing System

## Overview
This system calculates and visualizes risks for individual trades and portfolios based on historical trade and market data. It focuses on key risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and trade-specific loss probabilities.

## Key Features
- Machine learning models for predicting potential losses under normal and stress scenarios
- Monte Carlo simulations to model extreme market conditions
- Real-time market sentiment integration from news and social media
- Interactive dashboards for risk visualization and stress testing
- Simple risk assessment report generation (HTML, PDF, JSON formats)
- Low-latency API endpoints with security controls

## Components
1. **Data Ingestion**: Historical market data, trade data, and real-time sentiment feeds
2. **Risk Engine**: Core calculation of risk metrics
3. **Stress Testing**: Simulation of extreme market scenarios
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Processing of news and social media data
5. **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for risk monitoring
6. **API Layer**: Secure endpoints for all system functions
7. **Report Generation**: Customizable risk reports

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data processing and analysis
- FastAPI for API endpoints with JWT authentication
- Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations
- NLTK/spaCy for sentiment analysis
- Jinja2 and WeasyPrint for report generation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/risk-calculator.git
cd risk-calculator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Download NLTK data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

## Configuration

Create a `config/config.py` file with the following settings:

```python
# API security settings
JWT_SECRET = "your-secret-key"
JWT_ALGORITHM = "HS256"
JWT_EXPIRATION_SECONDS = 3600
CORS_ORIGINS = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8050"]

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED = True
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS = 100
RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD = 60  # seconds

# Sentiment API keys
FINNHUB_API_KEY = "your-finnhub-api-key"
NEWSAPI_API_KEY = "your-newsapi-key"
TWITTER_API_KEY = "your-twitter-api-key"
TWITTER_API_SECRET = "your-twitter-api-secret"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your-twitter-access-token"
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET = "your-twitter-access-secret"

# Paths
CACHE_DIR = "./cache"
MODEL_DIR = "./models"
REPORT_DIR = "./reports"
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The system provides a command-line interface with several commands:

```bash
# Run the interactive dashboard
python main.py dashboard

# Run the API server
python main.py api

# Run a system test with sample data
python main.py test

# Run the sentiment feed for specific symbols
python main.py sentiment --symbols AAPL MSFT GOOGL

# Generate a risk report
python main.py report --symbols AAPL MSFT --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31 --format html
```

### API Endpoints

Once the API server is running, the following endpoints are available:

- `GET /market-data`: Get historical market data for specified symbols
- `POST /calculate-risk`: Calculate risk metrics for trades
- `POST /stress-test`: Run stress tests on a portfolio
- `GET /sentiment/{symbol}`: Get sentiment data for a symbol
- `POST /sentiment/fetch`: Fetch sentiment data for symbols
- `POST /sentiment/schedule`: Schedule periodic sentiment data fetching
- `POST /ml/predict`: Make ML-based risk predictions
- `POST /report/generate`: Generate a risk assessment report

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the API server is running.

### Dashboard

The interactive dashboard provides visualization of:
- Portfolio overview with key risk metrics
- Trade-level risk details
- Monte Carlo simulation results
- Sentiment impact analysis
- Machine learning predictions

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8050` when running the dashboard command.

## System Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test suite that:
1. Generates sample market, trade, and sentiment data
2. Tests risk calculation functionality
3. Runs Monte Carlo simulations
4. Tests machine learning predictions
5. Analyzes sentiment data
6. Generates a sample risk report

Run the test with:

```bash
python main.py test
```
