# AI-Driven Trade Risk Assessment and Stress Testing System

## Overview
This system calculates and visualizes risks for individual trades and portfolios based on historical trade and market data. It focuses on key risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and trade-specific loss probabilities.

## Key Features
- Machine learning models for predicting potential losses under normal and stress scenarios
- Monte Carlo simulations to model extreme market conditions
- Real-time market sentiment integration from news and social media
- Interactive dashboards for risk visualization and stress testing

## Components
1. **Data Ingestion**: Historical market data, trade data, and real-time sentiment feeds
2. **Risk Engine**: Core calculation of risk metrics
3. **Stress Testing**: Simulation of extreme market scenarios
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Processing of news and social media data
5. **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for risk monitoring

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- PyTorch/TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Flask/FastAPI for API endpoints
- Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations
- NLTK/spaCy/Transformers for sentiment analysis
